## Code Quality

### Fixed Issues
- **Storage class bug**: Implemented missing `query()` method required by `DotQueryInterface`

### Test Organization
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/Unit/` - Tests for individual components
- **Feature Tests**: `tests/Feature/` - Integration and end-to-end tests
- **Fixtures**: `tests/Fixtures/` - Test data (gitignored)

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
composer test

# Unit tests only
composer test:unit

# Feature tests only
composer test:feature

# With coverage
composer test:coverage
```

## Test Patterns Used

### PHPUnit Style
- Traditional `public function testXxx()` methods
- `$this->assertEquals()`, `$this->assertTrue()`, etc.
- Setup and teardown methods
- Exception testing with `expectException()`

### Pest Style
- `it()` and `describe()` functions
- `expect()->toBe()`, `expect()->toBeTrue()`, etc.
- `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()` hooks
- Fluent assertion chaining

## Files Added

1. `.gitignore` - Excludes vendor, fixtures, and build artifacts
2. `phpunit.xml` - PHPUnit configuration
3. `tests/Pest.php` - Pest configuration
4. `tests/README.md` - Testing documentation
5. `tests/Unit/ConfigTest.php` - PHPUnit Config tests
6. `tests/Unit/ConfigPestTest.php` - Pest Config tests
7. `tests/Unit/StaticFactoryTest.php` - PHPUnit StaticFactory tests
8. `tests/Unit/FactoryTest.php` - PHPUnit Factory tests
9. `tests/Unit/FactoriesPestTest.php` - Pest Factory tests
10. `tests/Unit/Resource/Adapter/JsonAdapterTest.php` - PHPUnit JsonAdapter tests
11. `tests/Unit/Resource/Adapter/PhpAdapterTest.php` - PHPUnit PhpAdapter tests
12. `tests/Unit/AdaptersPestTest.php` - Pest Adapter tests
13. `tests/Feature/ConfigIntegrationTest.php` - Integration tests

## Files Modified

1. `composer.json` - Added PHPUnit and Pest dependencies, test scripts
2. `README.md` - Added testing section
3. `src/Storage/Storage.php` - Fixed missing query() method

## Dependencies Added

- `phpunit/phpunit: ^10.0`
- `pestphp/pest: ^2.0`

## CI/CD Ready

The test suite is ready for integration into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Install Dependencies
  run: composer install

- name: Run Tests
  run: composer test
```

## Next Steps

The test suite is complete and provides comprehensive coverage of all existing functionality. Future enhancements could include:

- Code coverage reporting
- Mutation testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Additional parser plugin tests (if needed for specific plugins)
